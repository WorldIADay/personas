Miguel's group interview with industry professionals at a UX Meetup in Santa Monica & Javier's interviews with professionals who are also WIAD attendees. 

Description:
"The Professional" represents a demographic of IA professionals who are well versed in community jargon and know exactly what he’s looking for, but he isn’t necessarily a WIAD attendant. He might additionally use the WIAD archive to see if he’d like to attend or contribute to the next World IA Day.
